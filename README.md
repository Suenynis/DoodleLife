# DoodleLife

DoodleLife is an innovative platform that allows kids and users of all ages to draw characters and bring them to life. These animated characters can talk, listen, and interact with users, all while maintaining a friendly and kid-appropriate personality. The platform aims to foster creativity and learning through interactive technology.

## Features

- **Drawing Interface**: Easy-to-use web-based canvas for creating and uploading hand-drawn characters.
- **Animation**: Transforms drawings into animated 2D/3D models using computer vision.
- **Voice Interaction**: Characters communicate through integrated text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) systems.
- **Personality Assignment**: Assigns friendly personalities to characters based on their visual traits.
- **Responsive Design**: Initially web-based with plans for mobile expansion.

## Current Status

- **Research Phase**: Actively researching computer vision, animation libraries, and TTS/STT technologies.
- **Development Initiated**: Started building the drawing tool using React.js and Fabric.js.
- **System Upgrade Needed**: Planning to upgrade the development computer to better support project requirements.

## Future Plans

- **Character Animation**: Implementing advanced animation features to enhance character interactions.
- **Voice and NLP Integration**: Incorporating natural language processing for more dynamic and engaging dialogues.
- **Platform Expansion**: Extending the platform to mobile devices using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
- **Side Projects Integration**: Developing complementary side projects to support and enhance the main platform.

## Side Projects

Alongside the main project, working on additional side projects that will contribute to DoodleLife, including:

- **Custom Animation Tools**
- **Voice Modulation Features**
- **Educational Content Modules**

These projects will be linked to DoodleLifeâ€™s repository once completed.
